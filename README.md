# App-Summary

This Depository will store some useful [libraries](https://github.com/mcx2020/app-summary/tree/main/demo) and [demos](https://github.com/mcx2020/app-summary/tree/main/libs) which I met when doing different projections.

Some effects of them are same,but the actual methods are different.I think they are useful learning materials when when deeply understanding the related knowledge.
  
Now There are _4_ demos which could be read.

* [barrel-jquery](https://machaoxue.xyz/app-summary/demo/barrel-jquery/barrel.html)
* [barrel-vanilla](https://machaoxue.xyz/app-summary/demo/barrel-vanilla/barrel.html)
* [count-down-jquery](https://machaoxue.xyz/app-summary/demo/count-down-jquery/count-down.html)
* [waterfall](https://machaoxue.xyz/app-summary/demo/waterfall/waterfall.html)
