# App-Summary

This depository will store some useful *[libraries](https://github.com/mcx2020/app-summary/tree/main/libs)* and *[demos](https://github.com/mcx2020/app-summary/tree/main/demo)* which I met when learning.

Some effects of them are same,but the actual methods are different. I think they are useful learning materials when I want to deeply understand the related knowledge.

Now There are *4* demos which could be read.

* [barrel-jquery](https://mcx2020.github.io/app-summary/demo/barrel-jquery/barrel.html)
* [barrel-vanilla](https://mcx2020.github.io/app-summary/demo/barrel-vanilla/barrel.html)
* [count-down-jquery](https://mcx2020.github.io/app-summary/demo/count-down-jquery/count-down.html)
* [waterfall](https://mcx2020.github.io/app-summary/demo/waterfall/waterfall.html)
